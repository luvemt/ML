-The code consists of 3 modules; clustering.py, datapreprocess.py and optimal_params.py. 

-To run the code, type: python clustering.py <dataset_path>
    e.g python clustering.py faults.csv
-To run the iris dataset, type: python clustering.py iris
-The project5report.pdf is the report for the analysis of the clustering algorithms on the datasets
-The code displays the performance metric for iris, and runtime for both iris and faults.csv.
The code also plots diagrams for the elbow approach and for the determination of the DBSCAN parameters.
